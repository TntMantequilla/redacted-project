I know this menu is not pretty, will come with something else later

(this text updates automatically)

current found bugs:
- vowels remain playing when you return to the online menu
- check to know if you are still connected to the server

to do:
+ message that says server is already full when trying to connect
+ kick button
+ user names
+ literall chat
+ a message that says that the other player doesnt have the song you just selected so the game doesnt crash
+ add instructions in the online menu that tells you which keys are join and host
