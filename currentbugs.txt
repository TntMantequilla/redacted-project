I know this menu is not pretty, will come with something else later

(this text updates automatically)

current found bugs:
- ignore the disconnect function if you are in the onlinelobby state
- vowels remain playing when you return to the online menu
(FIXED) host in connection destruction does not allow rehosting
-client in disconnection does not allow to reconnect
- pressing a note while waiting for the other player crashes the game
- check to know if you are still connected to the server
