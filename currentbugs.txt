I know this menu is not pretty, will come with something else later

(ongoing characters and stages selection)

current found bugs:

- leftover X vs X code

to do:
+ check to know if you are still connected to the server
+ kick button
+ user names
+ a message that says that the other player doesnt have the song you just selected so the game doesnt crash
