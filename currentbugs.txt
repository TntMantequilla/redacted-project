I know this menu is not pretty, will come with something else later

current found bugs:
- goun to options (in lobby) on match update crashes the game 
  (fixed but not relased)
- on switch side, local: bf doesnt go back to idle
  (fixed but not relased)
- hardcoded pause songs do not play while waiting in match
  (fixed but not relased)
- ugly fucking menus (i hate this)


!!! nothing is final EVERYTHING will change later !!!
to do:
+ alternative skin for reskins characters
+ better looking menu
+ more players support (after public relase)
+ pasta night with 3 players online (same as above, will be another relase)
